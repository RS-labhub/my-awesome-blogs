## Moving to the end... 🥹
I don't know you're excited or not, but I'm very much excited!

The only Prerequisite is you must know "how to make open-source contributions?". Otherwise, you won't be able to do anything. I'll be writing a blog on it soon, but before that, go through the video that will tell you the basics of open-source contributions. This video is made by me and I tried to explain in as short as I could!

And please, try not to exploit the open source with bad codes or meaningless codes./.

Have a good day. All good forces on your side. Thanks for reading 💖
