# Ask Her Out 👰: A cool JavaScript project for the love of Developer's life 💖

![cover image](ezgif.com-speed.gif)

"Are you facing a relentless rejection from the one you adore?" 🥺
"Is your crush constantly denying your love?" 🥹
Don't worry, we all suffered from this (never mind, but don't count me in 🙂).
You know, you know what's the worst part? You love someone but never had enough guts to say to them. Don't do this. Just ask them once. Just because I'm saying??? Aahh no man! Just because you don't regret about it in the future. And wait wait wait, if she says no! _Respect her decision_. ❣️

🫸Stop! Where are you going??? _This blog is not a motivational blog and I'm not a love guru_! So, just enjoy this and see how developers propose their loved ones in their style! 🧑‍💻

Fasten your seat belts. Turn on your Developer Mode, and here we go!

## 🚨 Hormones Alert! 🔛
Starting with a short story. The idea behind making this project came when I loved someone and wouldn't be able to tell her. She's now with someone else. 💔 
Thanks for your tears but it's a lie. I made this project because it was in trend and nothing else 😂

I started this project by making it as simple as it could be. See the below reference!

But it was so so so... Common, I'm not going to say bad words to my project! But yeah, you can! 🙂

After some realization, I realized that I must realize and take that realization to real so that the realized realize will become realizable!

Here's the realization effect!
1. I made a total of 9 pages... Something like a story-line
2. I used plain css, and vanilla javascript for animations.
3. I made it as interesting as it could be!

## But how I built it ⁉️
> The oldest but finest web technologies, _HTML5_, _CSS3_, and _JavaScript_, are used in the construction of this Website. Using HTML5, I first constructed the basic framework of our website, specifying the design, text, and other components required for every page. Then designed the page using CSS3 and a powerful CSS framework "_BOOTSTRAP v5_". And then goes the animations, which are aided by just simple CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Therefore, by using them, I developed a visually appealing, engaging, and user-friendly proposal website that captivates and excites people from the time they enter by utilizing the powers of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Fun fact**: _The project is open-sourced! You can check out the files here: https://github.com/RS-labhub/ask-her-out. The files are organized about 90% and readability is about 70%+. This is a good project to enhance and boost your web dev journey!_

## ⚠️ Tips that should not be ignored
1️⃣ This project is not responsive yet! So please don't send it to any mobile viewers!
 - If you want me to help in making it responsive, then must read the contribution guidelines. Find the link here: https://github.com/RS-labhub/ask-her-out?tab=readme-ov-file#outbox_tray-set-up

2️⃣ I put my name as a copyright signature on every page. So, before sending it to anyone, try to customize it according to you and make it all yours! 💘

3️⃣ Follow 1 and 2. 🥰

## Never mind but it's a real-world project! 😁
You don't believe me, right? Well, I don't say anything without proof! About 3-5 days back, I checked this project. Rn, it has 3 forks, and one is public, so I gone through that. And found something interesting.

I hope sharing it here won't be a crime as it's public! 😉 Tbh I liked that and I felt hormones while I looked over it.

So, there's a guy named Farukh who used my project, Customized it, and proposed to someone!

Thanks for your time. As the project is OS, do customizations, add your version of "**ask her out**" website, and comment down the link. Never forget, that you're a developer. So show your love in developer mode itself! All the best!!!!!
