![cover image](<shepherd v1.gif>)

"_A person who protects, guides, or watches over a sheep or flocks of sheep is called a Shepherd_". But how devs can do shepherding?? **Shepherd Js**, one of the best OS tools to guide your users, and enable them to understand your application or a specific part of your application in a detailed and descriptive way.
&nbsp;
## What is [Shepherd](https://github.com/shepherd-pro/shepherd)?? üêè
Shepherd is a JavaScript library for guiding users through your app. It uses Floating UI, another open-source library, to render dialogs for each tour "step".
> In short, guide your users through a tour of your app.

You can create custom user onboarding tours, training, and announcements to drive user adoption.

## How to do Shepherding? üï∫üêë
Shepherd enables you to guide users through a custom tour or journey within your app or website. Highly customizable with minimal styles, Shepherd allows for powerful customization while being easy to use. Various frameworks are supported including React, Ember, Angular, Vue.js, ES Modules, or plain JavaScript.

### Steps to install Shepherd üõ†Ô∏è:
1. You can install shepherd directly using npm, yarn, pnpm, and bun by using the below command:
 - npm install: `npm install shepherd.js`
 - yarn install: `yarn add shepherd.js`
 - pnpm install: `pnpm add shepherd.js`
 - bun install: `bun add shepherd.js`

2. You can directly use the jsDelivr cdn too, to use shepherd.
```json
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/shepherd.js@13.0.0/dist/esm/shepherd.mjs"
></script>
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/shepherd.js@13.0.0/dist/css/shepherd.css"
/>
```
&nbsp;
### How to create steps? ü™ú
Creating shepherd tour are super easy, just follow the below code:
```js
const tour = new Shepherd.Tour({
		defaultStepOptions: {
			cancelIcon: {
				enabled: true
			},
			classes: 'class-1 class-2',
			scrollTo: { behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' }
		}
	});

	tour.addStep({
		title: 'Creating a Shepherd Tour',
		text: 'Creating a Shepherd tour is easy.
               Just create a "Tour" instance, and add as many
               steps as you want.',
		attachTo: {
			element: '.hero-example',
			on: 'bottom'
		},
		buttons: [
			{
				action() {
					return this.back();
				},
				classes: 'shepherd-button-secondary',
				text: 'Back'
			},
			{
				action() {
					return this.next();
				},
				text: 'Next'
			}
		],
		id: 'creating'
	});

	tour.start(); //starts the tour
```
&nbsp;
### How to change styling? üíÖ
The HTML that the ShepherdJS library injects into the page looks something like this:
```html
<div aria-describedby="step1-description" role="dialog" tabindex="0" class="shepherd-element shepherd-enabled" data-shepherd-step-id="step1" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px auto auto 0px; margin: 0px; transform: translate(393px, 302px);" data-popper-placement="bottom">
   <div class="shepherd-arrow" data-popper-arrow="" style="position: absolute; left: 0px; transform: translate(192px);"></div>
   <div class="shepherd-content">
      <div class="shepherd-text" id="step1-description">Users seem to be down by 12.4%. Is that bad?</div>
      <footer class="shepherd-footer"><button class=" shepherd-button " tabindex="0">Next</button></footer>
   </div>
</div>
```
Therefore, making it easier to target elements (for example the arrow) with something like the below..
```html
.shepherd-arrow {
  /* Some styles here... */
}
```
Also, if you noticed, when you added the steps, `id` is used. Therefore, that can also be used to target the description of a particular step.
&nbsp;
The above ones are some basic properties. If someone wants to show the **progress of the tour**, they can do that too! Follow the below lines of code:
```js
when: {
  show() {
    const currentStep = Shepherd.activeTour?.getCurrentStep();
    const currentStepElement = currentStep?.getElement();
    const header = currentStepElement?.querySelector('.shepherd-header');
    const progress = document.createElement('span');
    progress.style['margin-right'] = '315px';
    progress.innerText = `${Shepherd.activeTour?.steps.indexOf(currentStep) + 1}/${Shepherd.activeTour?.steps.length}`;
    header?.insertBefore(progress, currentStepElement.querySelector('.shepherd-cancel-icon'));
  }
}
```
&nbsp;
